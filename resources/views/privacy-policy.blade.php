					<p>Thank you for using MartialArtsZen! We wrote this Privacy Policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can access and control your information. By signing up for or using MartialArtsZen’s website (MartialArtsZen.com), content, apps, products, and services (the "Service") you consent to the collection and uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. The Service is owned and operated by ExperiZen, LLC. ("MartialArtsZen", "we" or "us"). If you have any questions, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:support@martialartszen.com." class="text-info">support@martialartszen.com.</a></p>
					<h4 class="mt-4">Information We Collect And How We Use It  </h4>
					<h5 class="mt-3"><i> Your MartialArtsZen Account Information </i></h5>
					<p>To use most features of the Service, you must create an account with MartialArtsZen, or create an account through Facebook or Google. When you create an account with MartialArtsZen, you must provide us your name and email address, and create a password. Your email address and password will be used together so you can securely access and maintain your MartialArtsZen account. We may also collect additional optional information from you such as location and demographic information. </p>
				
					<h5 class="mt-3"><i> Facebook and Google Connect </i></h5>
					<p>Rather than creating a MartialArtsZen account, you may log in to the Service using certain third party social networking accounts ("Third Party Account"), such as Facebook or Google. You may also be able to link your Third Party Account to you MartialArtsZen Account. To log in with or link your Third Party Account to MartialArtsZen, you must grant MartialArtsZen permission to receive information that is available through that third party site, according to the permission’s page (where you consent to link your Third Party Account) and your privacy settings for that Third Party Account. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Accounts. For example, if you connect through Facebook, we receive your username, email address, public profile, and friend list.  </p>

					<h5 class="mt-3"><i> Your Actions on MartialArtsZen  </i></h5>
					<p>When you use the MartialArtsZen Services, we collect information about the actions you take, including watching, searching for and collecting videos, entering comments or annotations, and following topics or users. All of the actions you take on MartialArtsZen are public, and may be visible to other MartialArtsZen users, or published to your linked Third Party Services accounts with your consent.  </p>

					<h5 class="mt-3"><i> Information We Collect Automatically   </i></h5>
